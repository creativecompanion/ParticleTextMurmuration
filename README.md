# ParticleTextMurmuration
This is not your average particle animation.

This is a living, breathing murmuration of dots—each one with a slightly neurotic personality—coming together to form legible phrases, then dissolving into elegant chaos. Built for the Creative Companion project, this animation system is a kinetic meditation on emergence, structure, and surprise. It’s as if a swarm of curious sardines started writing poetry mid-flight.

Features
🧠 Particles with adjustable "personality" traits—energy, curiosity, patience—because yes, your UI can have moods.

🐟 Real-time flocking behaviors: particles drift, swirl, explore, then converge into meaning like a well-trained shoal.

🎛️ Full control panel to tweak animation physics, timing, mouse interactions, and text formation. Presets included.

✍️ Text morphs dynamically between phrases, driven by mouse interaction thresholds or manual buttons.

🎨 Designed to feel alive—no harsh transitions, no static pauses. Just constant, expressive motion.

Usage
Open index.html in a browser. Move your mouse. Click the buttons. Tweak the sliders. Feel smug.

To swap out the default phrases, edit the texts array in the JavaScript near the top.

Philosophy
This isn’t just for show. It’s a playful, behaviorally-tuned front-end experiment for expressing creative states—restlessness, resonance, risk—and helping people feel their way into new ideas. No branding. No logos. Just motion with meaning.

Dev Notes
Built with vanilla JS and HTML5 Canvas. No frameworks. No WebGL. Just pain and pixels.

Font: Satoshi via Google Fonts.

Tested on modern desktop browsers. Mobile’s a mess—deal with it later.
